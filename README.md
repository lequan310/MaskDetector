# Face Mask Detector

## Description:
* The objective of this project is to develop a model that can identify whether people are wearing face mask or not, which can be used to monitor the public via IoT during the pandemic.
* Dataset is available in roboflow: https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/mask-wearing
* We will apply data processing techniques such as data augmentation, and then train the model using YOLO script: https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/yolov5-custom-training-tutorial/blob/main/yolov5-custom-training.ipynb
* Download finished model and use it for inference.
